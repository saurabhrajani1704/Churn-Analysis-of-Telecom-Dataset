# Churn Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing customer churn data to identify key factors that contribute to churn and to develop predictive models for identifying customers who are likely to churn. The analysis is conducted using a Jupyter Notebook and includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model development.

## File Contents

- **Churn Analysis.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, including data loading, preprocessing, visualization, and model building.

## Features

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
- **Data Import**: Loading the churn dataset into the notebook.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
- **Data Transformation**: Encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical features.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary statistics of the dataset.
- **Visualizations**: Charts and graphs to explore the relationships between features and the target variable (churn).

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for predicting churn.
- **Feature Creation**: Creating new features to improve model performance.

### 4. Model Development
- **Model Selection**: Choosing appropriate machine learning models for churn prediction.
- **Model Training**: Training the models on the preprocessed dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 5. Predictions and Insights
- **Churn Prediction**: Making predictions on new data to identify potential churners.
- **Business Insights**: Interpreting the model results to provide actionable insights for reducing churn.

## Getting Started

1. **Software Requirements**:
   - Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
   - Python (latest version)
   - Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

2. **Installation**:
   - Install Jupyter Notebook from the [official Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).
   - Install the required Python libraries using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
     ```

3. **Opening the Project**:
   - Open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the `Churn Analysis.ipynb` file.
   - Open the `Churn Analysis.ipynb` file.

4. **Running the Notebook**:
   - Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
   - Modify the code and parameters as needed to customize the analysis.

## Customization

- **Data**: Replace the dataset with your own customer churn data by updating the data loading section.
- **Models**: Experiment with different machine learning models and hyperparameters to improve performance.
- **Visualizations**: Customize the visualizations to better suit your needs or to highlight specific insights.
